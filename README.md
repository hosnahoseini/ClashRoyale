# Clash Royale
This is a game create by supercell, and we have created a small model of it for advance programming course at Amirkabir University of Technology - Spring 2021!<br>
Although It has a class diagram which you can check hear (FYI: it must be opened by <a href="https://app.diagrams.net/">diagrams.io</a>), It may be hard to figure out what is what! but we have provided class with proper name and comments to help you through this process!<br>
Most of assets are gathered from open source github repos and some of them are created by ourself anyway you are free to use this code and improve it but remember the name of us and do not remove our name from created class by this team!<br>
If you like to improve the project contact me!<br>
I hope you engoy!
